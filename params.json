{"name":"Jsspell","tagline":"A spellchecker written in JavaScript","body":"jsSpell - a spellchecker written in JavaScript\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis spellchecker is a subset of the spellchecker of Chromium written in JavaScript so JavaScript applications can check words with spellchecker dictionaries used by Chromium. Chromium uses a custom version of hunspell to use custom spellchecker dictionaries, which is called as BDICTs. This library reads BDICT dictionaries used by Chromium and check words with them. (This is just a prototype and it does not implement all features of hunspell, though.)\r\nFor those who like to evaluate jsSpell with your browser, we provide [a test page](http://hbono.github.io/jsSpell/jsspell-test.html) that spell-checks words with spellchecker dictionaries of Chromium.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis library is implemented in pure JavaScript and works with all major browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, IE10+, Safari, etc.) This library also includes a sample web application 'jsspell.html' and 'jsspell-test.js' so we can check words with BDICT dictionaries. To use this sample application, follow the steps listed below.\r\n\r\n0. Download BDICT files from [the Chromium repository](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/hunspell_dictionaries/).\r\n1. Download all JavaScript files and HTML files in this project.\r\n2. Open [the test page](http://hbono.github.io/jsSpell/jsspell-test.html) with your favorite browser.\r\n3. Open a BDICT file in the test page.\r\n4. Type a word in the \"Word\" input box and press the \"OK\" button.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
